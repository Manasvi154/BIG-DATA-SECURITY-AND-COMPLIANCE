# BIG-DATA-SECURITY-AND-COMPLIANCE

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: MANASVI KISAN PAWAR

INTERN ID: CT08DN290

DOMAIN: BIG DATA

DURATION: 8 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

The final task involves designing a Big Data security and compliance framework, with alignment to data regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. This task tests the understanding of not just technical
tools, but also governance, privacy, and regulatory considerations.
The submitted report outlines key security requirements: data confidentiality, integrity, availability, access control, encryption, and audit logging. Each component is explained with
practical implementations like role-based access control (RBAC), data masking, backup strategies, and secure transmission protocols (HTTPS, SFTP).

A layered architecture is proposed, including:
Identity & Access Management
Data Ingestion Security
Secure Storage
Data Processing Security
Compliance Services
Monitoring & Auditing

Regulation-specific practices were detailed:
GDPR: Right to Access, Right to Erasure, Consent Management
HIPAA: Safeguards for PHI, access trails, and Business Associate Agreements

A code prototype was also included, using PySpark to demonstrate secure data handling by masking emails and hashing SSNs using sha2() and lit(). This code highlights how big data systems can
enforce privacy during data processing.
The conclusion summarized that following such a framework reduces risk, improves data trust, and ensures alignment with regulatory frameworks. This task demonstrates knowledge of both the
architectural and ethical aspects of big data systems.
